Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

    text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

    text-align: center; centers the text

    text-align: right; right-aligns the text

    and text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property

img {
    width: 220px;
}

Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property

img {
    height: 20px;
}

Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold

    With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

    <strong>Stanford University</strong>

Use the u Tag to Underline Text

    With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

    <u>Ph.D. students</u>

    Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.

Use the em Tag to Italicize Text

    To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.

    <em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em>

Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text

    With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.

    <s>Google</s>

Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

    <hr>

    Note: In HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.

Adjust the background-color Property of Text

rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity

background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)

Adjust the Size of a Heading Element Versus a Paragraph Element

h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
}

Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element

    The box-shadow property takes values for

    offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
    offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
    blur-radius,
    spread-radius and
    color, in that order.

    The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

Decrease the Opacity of an Element

    A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
    A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
    A value of 0 is completely transparent.

    opacity: 0.7;

Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase

    Value	Result
    lowercase	"transform me"
    uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
    capitalize	"Transform Me"
    initial	Use the default value
    inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
    none	Default: Use the original text

    text-transform: uppercase;

Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements

    font-size: 68px;

Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements

    font-weight: 800;

Set the font-size of Paragraph Text

    The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.

Set the line-height of Paragraphs

    line-height: 25px;

Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

a:hover {
    color: red;
}

Change an Element's Relative Position

p {
    position: relative;
    bottom: 10px;
}

Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets

    The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning

  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    right: 50px;
  }

Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

    One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

  #navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #767676;
  }

Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property

    The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.

    <style>
    #left {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
    }
    #right {
    float: right;
    width: 40%;
    }
    aside, section {
    padding: 2px;
    background-color: #ccc;
    }
    </style>

Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property

    When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

    z-index: 2;

Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property

    Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

    This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block.

    margin: auto;

Learn about Complementary Colors

    Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:

    red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
    green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
    blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)

    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model]

Learn about Tertiary Colors

    Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

    Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

    Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

    Color	Hex Code
    orange	#FF7F00
    cyan	#00FFFF
    raspberry	#FF007F

Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors

    The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.

Adjust the Hue of a Color

    Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

    Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

    Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

    Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

    Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

    Color	HSL
    red	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
    yellow	hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
    green	hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
    cyan	hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
    blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
    magenta	hsl(300, 100%, 50%)

Adjust the Tone of a Color

    The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.

Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient

    Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:

    background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

    The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

    Example:

    background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

    background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF, #FFCCCC);

Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element

    The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.

    The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.

    In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.

    For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.

    0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px

    If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.

    background: repeating-linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        yellow 0px,
        yellow 40px,
        black 40px,
        black 80px
    );

Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image

    One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.

    <style>
    body {
        background: url(https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png);
    }
    </style>

Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element

    To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:

    p {
    transform: scale(2);
    }

Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover

    The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

    Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

    p:hover {
    transform: scale(2.1);
    }

    Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.

Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis

    The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

    The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

    p {
    transform: skewX(-32deg);
    }

Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis

    Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.
    
Create a Graphic Using CSS

    By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML

.heart::before {
    content: "";
    background-color: yellow;
    border-radius: 25%;
    position: absolute;
    height: 50px;
    width: 70px;
    top: -50px;
    left: 5px;
}

    For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border-radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work

    To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

    animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

    animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

    @keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:

    #anim {
    animation-name: colorful;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    }

    @keyframes colorful {
    0% {
        background-color: blue;
    }
    100% {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    }

    For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.

Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button

    You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

    Here's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:

    <style>
    img {
        width: 30px;
    }
    img:hover {
        animation-name: width;
        animation-duration: 500ms;
    }

    @keyframes width {
        100% {
        width: 40px;
        }
    }
    </style>

    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/applied-visual-design/google-logo.png" alt="Google's Logo" />

Modify Fill Mode of an Animation

    That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.
    
    This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:
    
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;

Create Movement Using CSS Animation

    When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.
    
    As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the 50% keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.
    
    @keyframes rainbow {
      0% {
        background-color: blue;
        top: 0px;
      }
      50% {
        background-color: green;
        top: 50px;
      }
      100% {
        background-color: yellow;
        top: 0px;
      }
    }

Create Visual Direction by Fading an Element from Left to Right

    For this challenge, you'll change the opacity of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.
    
    In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.

    opacity: 0.1;

Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count

    The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:
    
    animation-iteration-count: 3;

    In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.
    
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;

Make a CSS Heartbeat using an Infinite Animation Count

    Here's one more continuous animation example with the animation-iteration-count property that uses the heart you designed in a previous challenge.

    The one-second long heartbeat animation consists of two animated pieces. The heart elements (including the :before and :after pieces) are animated to change size using the transform property, and the background div is animated to change its color using the background property.

Animate Elements at Variable Rates

    There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.
    
    To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two stars that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.

Animate Multiple Elements at Variable Rates

    In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.
    
    In the animation running in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.

Change Animation Timing with Keywords

    In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.
    
    There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.

    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;

Learn How Bezier Curves Work

    The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.

    In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

    The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);

    In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.

Use a Bezier Curve to Move a Graphic

    A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

    In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:

    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);

    Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

Make Motion More Natural Using a Bezier Curve

    This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.

    The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

    The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

    cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);

    Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.
