Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

    text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

    text-align: right; right-aligns the text

    and text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold

    With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

    <strong>Stanford University</strong>

Use the u Tag to Underline Text

    With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

    <u>Ph.D. students</u>

    Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.

Use the em Tag to Italicize Text

    To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.

    <em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em>

Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text

    With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.

Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

    <hr>

    Note: In HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.

Adjust the background-color Property of Text

rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity

background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)

Adjust the Size of a Heading Element Versus a Paragraph Element

h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
}

Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element

    The box-shadow property takes values for

    offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
    offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
    blur-radius,
    spread-radius and
    color, in that order.

    The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

Decrease the Opacity of an Element

    A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
    A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
    A value of 0 is completely transparent.

    opacity: 0.7;

Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase

    Value	Result
    lowercase	"transform me"
    uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
    capitalize	"Transform Me"
    initial	Use the default value
    inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
    none	Default: Use the original text

    text-transform: uppercase;

    line-height: 25px;

Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

a:hover {
    color: red;
}

Change an Element's Relative Position

p {
    position: relative;
    bottom: 10px;
}

Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets

    The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning

  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    right: 50px;
  }

Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

    One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

  #navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #767676;
  }
